excerpt: 'This retrospective cohort study evaluated whether ultraviolet B–based phototherapy for eczema is associated with an increased risk of skin cancer. Among 925 patients treated with broadband or narrowband UVB (with or without UVA), no clear evidence of increased skin cancer risk was identified over a median follow-up of 5.1 years, helping address uncertainty regarding the carcinogenic safety of phototherapy in eczema.'
