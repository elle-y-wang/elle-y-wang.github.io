excerpt: 'This review summarizes current advances in vitamin A metabolism and retinoic acid–mediated signaling, focusing on the roles of nuclear receptors in regulating gene expression involved in energy metabolism. It highlights evidence that retinoic acid influences glucose and lipid metabolism through multiple transcriptional pathways, with important implications for metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes.'
