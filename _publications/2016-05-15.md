excerpt: 'This cross-sectional study investigated the expression and clinical relevance of α-klotho in normal and preeclamptic pregnancies. It found that α-klotho levels were significantly reduced in placental tissue and in maternal and umbilical cord serum in preeclampsia, and that lower α-klotho was associated with poorer fetal outcomes and disease-related biomarkers, suggesting its potential as a predictor of preeclampsia.'
