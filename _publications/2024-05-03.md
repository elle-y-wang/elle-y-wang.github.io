excerpt: 'This observational cohort study evaluated real-time oxygen saturation during opioid smoking at overdose prevention service sites using continuous pulse oximetry. It found that while SpO₂ fluctuated widely and was not consistently linked to individual inhalations, cumulative inhalations were associated with transient hypoxemia, supporting pulse oximetry as a safe monitoring tool and highlighting the complexity of overdose risk during inhalation.'
