excerpt: 'This cross-sectional study examined the association between eating frequency patterns and obesity among Chinese adults using dietary recall and lifestyle data. After adjusting for sociodemographic and behavioral factors, eating frequency was not independently associated with obesity, suggesting that other factors such as education, nutrition knowledge, and physical activity play a more important role.'
