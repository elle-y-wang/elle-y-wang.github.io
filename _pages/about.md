I am an Analytical Project Manager in the Department of Emergency Medicine at the University of British Columbia [Moe Lab] (https://moelab.med.ubc.ca/), with a cross-appointment as an Analytical Lead at the BC Centre for Disease Control. My work focuses on large-scale health data analysis using clinical electronic medical records and provincial administrative health datasets, supported by strong expertise in clinical study design, data linkage, and multi-institutional research coordination. Through sustained engagement with real-world data, I have developed a deep understanding of the methodological, ethical, and practical challenges involved in generating reliable evidence within complex health systems. I have extensive experience in academic writing and publishing across multiple projects, including first-author publications in high-quality peer-reviewed journals. My research trajectory increasingly emphasizes the application of artificial intelligence and advanced analytics in healthcare, bridging clinical research and computational methods. I engage with emerging methodological approaches for analyzing diverse health data modalities and am motivated to develop robust, interpretable AI methods that translate advances in machine learning into meaningful progress in health sciences.

Outside of work, I enjoy cooking and spending time at home with my two cats—an orange tabby and a silver tabby—who are siblings from the same litter. While I naturally gravitate toward a home-based lifestyle, I also enjoy traveling from time to time as a way to step back, recharge, and explore new environments.
