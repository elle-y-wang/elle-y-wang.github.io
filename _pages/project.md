## AI-Enabled Clinical Intelligence for Toxic-Drug–Related Emergency Care

### Screening for Critical Opioid Events in Emergency Departments (SCOPE)
**AI-Enabled Clinical Indicator for Toxic-Drug-Related ED Presentations**

This project develops the analytical foundation for an AI-informed clinical indicator to improve detection of toxic-drug-related presentations in emergency departments. Using large-scale electronic medical records (EMRs), including both structured data and unstructured clinical notes, the work focuses on designing responsible and scalable workflows for clinical natural language processing and machine-learning–ready feature generation.

Key contributions include building secure Databricks pipelines for clinical text processing (XML/RTF parsing, de-templating, redaction-aware cleaning, tokenisation), defining an end-to-end analytical framework for transformer-based models (e.g. BERT, ClinicalBERT, BigBird), and empirically comparing deep-learning approaches with tree-based models such as XGBoost. The project emphasises interpretability, bias assessment, data-drift monitoring and alignment with privacy and governance constraints in emergency-care settings.

**Impact:** Established AI-ready analytical workflows and variable frameworks that now guide early implementation and model prototyping for clinical deployment.

### Developing a BC Pilot Data Space for Toxic-Drug Crisis Response
**Linking Emergency-Department EMRs with Provincial Administrative Health Data**

This initiative designs linkage-ready analytical structures to integrate emergency-department EMRs with provincial administrative datasets, including hospital discharge and physician billing records. The goal is to enable multi-layer validation of AI-informed clinical indicators across complementary clinical and public-health data systems.

The work addresses challenges in harmonising heterogeneous datasets across organisations with differing metadata standards, governance regimes and privacy constraints. Contributions include analytical planning for cross-system linkage, leadership of a national-level funding application, and coordination with health-authority engineers, surveillance teams, governance committees and national partners such as the Canadian Emergency Department Research Network (CEDRN).

**Impact:** Provided the analytical and governance groundwork for a secure, interoperable National Data Space, positioning the project for multi-site expansion and external validation.

## Physiological Time-Series Modelling and Harm Reduction

### Time-Series Analysis of Oxygen Saturation and Pulse Dynamics During Inhalation Monitoring

This project develops a methodological roadmap for analysing real-world physiological time-series data surrounding inhalation events. Signals include oxygen saturation, pulse rate and perfusion index, collected in noisy, low-volume clinical environments.

The work evaluates traditional statistical approaches alongside machine-learning methods such as one-dimensional convolutional neural networks, recurrent models and transformer-based architectures. A phased analytical plan was designed, progressing from data-quality assessment and exploratory analysis to hand-crafted time-window feature engineering, with clearly defined criteria for transitioning to deep-learning models once data volume and labelling quality permit.

**Impact:** Delivered a structured, clinically grounded framework supporting feasibility assessment and future implementation of advanced time-series models.

## Clinical Risk Modelling and NLP-Guided Reporting

### Skin Cancer Risk Characterisation and NLP-Guided Clinical Reporting

This project investigates phenotypic, demographic and behavioural risk factors for melanoma, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma within a Canadian dermatology cohort. Structured multivariable logistic regression models were combined with exploratory transformer-based semantic analysis of categorical questionnaire items.

The work explored how semantic representations can clarify variable meaning, support conceptual grouping of risk factors and inform the design of interpretable, personalised clinical report templates.

**Impact:** Produced an integrated framework combining traditional epidemiological modelling with modern NLP methods to support clinician-facing risk reporting.
