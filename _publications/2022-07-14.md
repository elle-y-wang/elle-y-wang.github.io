excerpt: 'This retrospective cohort study used administrative data from Ontario, Alberta, and British Columbia to identify and characterize subgroups of adults with frequent emergency department visits related to substance use. It found consistent “extreme” and “moderate” frequent-use subgroups across provinces, with the extreme group showing higher healthcare utilization, poorer continuity of care, and elevated mortality, underscoring the need for improved substance use treatment and coordinated primary and mental healthcare.'
