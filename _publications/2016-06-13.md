excerpt: 'This meta-analysis investigated the relationship between eating frequency, obesity risk, and energy intake in adults without dietary restrictions. It found that higher eating frequency was associated with a lower risk of obesity but a higher total energy intake, suggesting a complex and potentially compensatory effect that requires confirmation in clinical trials.'
