excerpt: 'This retrospective cohort study examined patterns of persistent frequent emergency department use in Ontario and Alberta by categorizing adults according to the number of years they met the threshold for frequent visits. It found that although most frequent users met the threshold for only one year, those with persistent frequent use had progressively higher comorbidity burdens, mental health and substance use–related issues, and social vulnerabilities, highlighting the need for upstream and emergency department–based interventions to address unmet clinical and social needs.'
